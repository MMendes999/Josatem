#Implementing HapiJs in my side-project website

After learning a little about HapiJs and all its immense power
I decided I needed to build something with it and use what I had learned.
Thus using a side-project I had literally put aside for the last few months,
I thought it would be cool to use the website and integrate HapiJs into it.

This is not a finished website. 

For what counts I wanted to display my template files and the respective styles and Js files
using HapiJs and this is the result.
